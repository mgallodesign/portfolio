            <!-- About GKIDS -->
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p><a href="https://gkids.com/">GKIDS</a> is the producer and distributor of award-winning feature animation for adult and family audiences. Since 2010, the company has scored an astounding 13 Best Animated Feature Oscar® nominations with films like When Marnie Was There in 2016, Mirai in 2019, and Wolfwalkers in 2021. GKIDS also handles North American distribution for the famed Studio Ghibli library of films, one of the world’s most coveted animation collections with titles such as Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro, Princess Mononoke, and others; as well as the critically-acclaimed television series, Neon Genesis Evangelion.</p>
                <p>ANIMATION IS FILM is an annual animation festival, produced by GKIDS in collaboration with Annecy International Animation Film Festival and Variety. It showcases some of the best new animated films from around the world with programs for both adults and families.
                    During this time, I worked with the GKIDS Design Manager and followed set brand guidelines to create graphics for the 2023 Animation Is Film Festival. I created around 40 slides in various dimensions for the screen, along with approximately 30 social graphics designed for Instagram stories & posts. Additionally, I carefully quality-checked all elements to ensure they were suitable for all screenings.
                    Here are a few examples of the assets I helped update.</p>

                <p>GKIDS also engages with its audience to convey new, time-sensitive updates about film releases and limited-time offers at its store via email. As a result, I was tasked with formatting relevant information according to each film's unique design sensibilities and established brand guidelines with edits and approval coming from the GKIDS Design Manager. Throughout this time, I employed clear, communicative visuals that left a lasting impact on the audience.</p>

                <p>GKIDS presents an annual Studio Ghibli festival as a chance for fans to enjoy all ten of Hayao Miyazaki's classic animated films. Promotional assets of multiple proportions, such as banners, social media posts, and header images for partner websites, were made to inform audiences of when each film would be on the big screen. 
                    After Ghibli Fest, I helped prepare many graphics for the Oscar® nominated film The Boy and the Heron, as well as updating email blasts for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for three months.

                    GKIDS released a collection of films created by the renowned director and animator, Masaaki Yuasa. My task was to design a <a href="https://gkids.com/yuasa/">website</a> that would best showcase Yuasa's artistic vision and introduce new audiences to his innovative and wildly expressive films. To achieve this, I organized the site by using his illustrations as a reference point to highlight his unique approach to the medium.

                    Early on, I was asked to propose redesigns for GKIDS’ Carrd site. I compared the existing designs to the sites of other entertainment companies and mapped out the users’ experience. After presenting my research, I suggested switching to a simpler, more mobile-friendly design that didn’t rely on generating custom graphics for each link.</p>
