                    I created Abandon In Time; as a means to help those sorting through their feelings of fear, abandonment, and loneliness amid the pandemic. Each page of this easy-to-print booklet features an interactive prompt to provoke memories and encourage documentation. Derived from Emotion-Focused Therapy (EMT), it proposes the centrality of emotion in meaning-making and adaptive behavior.  Activities within these pages include drawing, writing, or collecting—helpful tools used to better acquaint the person with their inner selves and sore spots.

                    <b>Q: </b> What does it mean to be abandoned? 
                    <br> 
                    <b>A: </b> <i>​​​​At its core, abandonment refers to an absence in responsibility that changes the status quo. Once it's happened, it destabilizes what was known, resulting in an emotional and/or physical withdrawal. The pain lingers in fragmented emotions, like pieces of a disassembled puzzle with no guide. Time, care, and attention are needed to smooth down old splinters, but can also expose even older wounds. By examining our abandoned spaces, we acknowledge emotion, thought, and healing processes. In the spirit of community and kinship, I hope to create a functioning website that centers around collecting, displaying, and sharing answers publicly. Submitted stories would be displayed for all to read—whether they be positive, negative, or anything in between. Sharing these moments can provide solace or validation, especially to those wanting anonymity.</i>
