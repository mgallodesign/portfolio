                    For nearly 40 years, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/unitedmeatmarket/?hl=en">United Meat Market</a> has been a beloved fixture in Windsor Terrace. In a city with a dwindling number of specialized butcher shops, they offer a particular service that can’t quite be replicated elsewhere. Year after year, they’ve provided fresh meat, imported Italian specialty goods, and made fresh mozzarella and tomato sauce by hand. While their customers have always praised them for their delicious food and great customer service, United has remained a relatively unknown gem in the heart of Brooklyn. As such, I designed a memorable, yet classic branding guideline to set this butcher shop apart from the mold.

                    It was key to maintain United's brand familiarity—The storefront's outdoor signage is a bold, no-nonsense 'MEAT MARKET' sign set in a generic typeface, but frequent customers are familiar with it just as much as they are with the owners. Using this logic, I looked at what the business worked with, day in and day out. The tactile materiality of items like butcher’s twine and freezer paper helped inform my final decisions for the brand-new logo and interior signage system. As such, a fresh take on a combination of texture, color, and shape helped create the final graphic identity for the place that has served the people of Park Slope for so many years.
